# MineSweeper-Sprint_3
Three new features added to sprint_2 version.

1.Uncover an initial set of empty squares.
2.Decoupling game rules from user interface, making it possible to play the same game,
  without changes, through different user interfaces.
3.Improve the appearance of console inputs and outputs.

Following java projects are included :

  - minesweeper_sprint3 contains all the necessary to implement game rules. 
    It will not contain Main class because the game will not be launched from 
    this project any more but from one of the other projects acting as game interfaces.

   - minesweeper.mp.p3.console implements a console interface with the game (text-based interface).

   - minesweeper.mp.p3.gui implements a graphical user interface (GUI)
